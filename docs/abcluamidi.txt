# ABCLuaMidi


## Description
Compatible implementation of abc2midi, written in Lua, using the ABCLua library.

Transforms ABC into playable MIDI. 

## Supported features
See [abc2midi](http://ifdo.pugmarks.com/~seymour/runabc/abcguide/abc2midi_guide.html) documentation for description of the operation of these features.

* Beat accenting `beat` `beatmod` `beatstring`
* Stress models (articulation and time distortion) `ptstress` `stressmodel`
* Transposition `transpose` `rtranspose`
* Guitar chords (with arpeggiation) `gchord` `chordname` `gchordon` `gchordoff`
* MIDI control `control` `pitchbend`
* Strumming `chordattack` `randomchordattack`
* Drum patterns `drum` `drumon` `drumoff` `drumbars` `drummap`
* Drones `drone` `droneon` `droneoff`
* Microtones `^/4C`
* Linear temperament `temperamentlinear` `temperamentnormal`
* Accidental propagation `propagate-accidentals`
* Programs, channels `program` `channel`
* Articulation `trim`
* Grace notes `gracedivider` (but not `grace`)

#### Not supported/partial support
* lyrics 
* Per voice drum/chord/bass channels
* `snt` for tuning
* `nobarlines` `barlines` (use `propagate-accidentals` instead)

#### Extensions

* `gracedivider 0` turns off grace notes


### Requires: 
* [Lua 5.2](http://www.lua.org)
* [LPeg](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg)
* [MIDI.lua](http://www.pjb.com.au/comp/lua/MIDI.html)


    
## Using
`generate_midi myfile.abc` creates `myfile.mid`

## Differences

* `drum` maps each note/velocity to each hit in the sequence, not each `d` character. So `%%MIDI drum ddz 40 40 100 100` and `%%MIDI drum d2z 40 40 100` are equivalent.
* `grace` is not supported. Use `gracedivider`
* `ratio` is not supported, but ABCLua's `%%set-broken-ratio` has the same effect
* There are no built in stress patterns. You need to define them with `stressmodel`.
